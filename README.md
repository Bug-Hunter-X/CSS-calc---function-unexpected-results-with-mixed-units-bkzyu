This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the CSS `calc()` function. The bug arises when using percentages alongside fixed units (like pixels) without explicitly defining the parent element's dimensions. The `calc()` function might produce unexpected results, resulting in inconsistent layout across different browsers. The solution involves setting explicit dimensions for the parent element, ensuring that the calculation within `calc()` operates correctly.
